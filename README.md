Project
It's a trial to make modules.
which imported from cood.py to stringOpps.py
That can make 4 functions
“Repeated Substring”, “Simple String Matching”, “is it a palindrome?”, "Find the nth occurrence of a word in a string!" -and “the repeated substring solved in to Mainers”
	You can use is_palindrome function:
      To for checking the string is_palindrome or not.
	You can use regex  
       Find a minimum substring t and the maximum number k
	You can use find_nth_occurrence function:
Which return the index of nth occurrence of a substring within a string (considering that those substrings could overlap each other’s)
. if there are less than n occurrences of the substring and return -1)
	You can use solve function:
To check if strings matches, return true else false.
